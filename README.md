# Flipping Card Animation Project

## Overview

This repository contains a project for creating a Flipping Card Animation using Figma. The inspiration for this project came from watching YouTube videos, where the goal was to implement an animated flipping card effect. Figma, a popular design tool, was used to create and prototype the design.

## Project Structure

- **/designs**: This directory contains Figma design files (.fig) where the card animation was initially created and prototyped.

- **/images**: Any images or assets used in the Figma project can be found here.

## How to Use

1. Open the Figma design file in the `/designs` directory using Figma.

2. Explore the design elements, layers, and interactions to understand how the flipping card animation was implemented.

3. Customize the design to fit your own project requirements, such as changing colors, content, or adding additional features.

4. Use the Figma prototype feature to preview the animation and interactions.

## Credits
